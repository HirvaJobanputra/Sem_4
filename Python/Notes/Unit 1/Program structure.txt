Certainly, you can use the following as an answer to the prompt "Explain the program structure of Python using a suitable example.":

Python Program Structure

Writing Python Code:

You can write Python code in any text editor (like Notepad, Sublime Text, VS Code) or an IDE (like PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook).
Save the file with the .py extension.
Data Types:

Python dynamically determines the data type of a variable based on its assigned value.
Common data types include:
Numbers:
int (integers, e.g., 10, -5)
float (floating-point numbers, e.g., 3.14, -2.5)
Strings: Text enclosed in single ('') or double ("") quotes (e.g., "Hello", 'World')
Booleans: True or False
Indentation:

Python relies heavily on indentation (usually 4 spaces or a tab) to define code blocks.
This is essential for control flow structures like:
Conditional statements: if, elif, else
Loops: for, while
