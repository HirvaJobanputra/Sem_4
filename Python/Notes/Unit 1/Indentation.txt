In python, indentation is not just for styling purpose. It's crucial for defining code blocks. Unlike other languages that use {} to group a code, python relies on consistent spacing to define which code is associated with which block.
 Python's interpreter uses indentation to determine the structure of your program. Incorrect indentation will lead to IndentationError and prevent the code from running correctly.
