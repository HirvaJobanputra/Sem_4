Certainly! In Python, comments are lines of code that are ignored by the interpreter. 
They are used to:

Explain the code: Add notes to clarify the purpose of specific lines, functions, or sections of code. This helps in understanding the code's logic and improves maintainability.
Document the code: Provide information about the program, its author, and any relevant details.
Temporarily disable code: Comment out lines of code to temporarily disable them during testing or debugging without deleting them.
1. Single line comments: #
2. Multiline comments:""" """,''' '''
