Variables

What they are:

A variable is a named container that stores a value.
This value can be of different types like numbers (integers, floats), text (strings), or more complex data structures (lists, dictionaries).
How to use them:

You assign a value to a variable using the equals sign (=).
For example:
age = 30
name = "Alice"
price = 9.99
Naming rules:

Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
 
They are case-sensitive (e.g., age and Age are different variables).
Avoid using reserved keywords (like if, for, while) as variable names.
Tokens

What they are:
Tokens are the smallest individual units of code in a Python program.
They are like the building blocks of your code.
Examples of tokens:
Identifiers: Names given to variables, functions, classes (e.g., age, my_function, Person).
Literals: Direct representations of values (e.g., 30 (integer), 3.14 (float), "Hello" (string), True (boolean)).
Operators: Symbols that perform actions (e.g., + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), = (assignment)).
Keywords: Reserved words with special meanings in Python (e.g., if, else, for, while, def, class).
Punctuators: Symbols used for various purposes (e.g., (, ), {, }, [, ], :, ,).
