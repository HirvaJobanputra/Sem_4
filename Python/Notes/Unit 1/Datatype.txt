Certainly! In Python, data types define the kind of data a variable can hold. Here's a breakdown of some common data types:

**1. Numbers**

* **int:** Represents whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5, 0).
    * `x = 10` 

* **float:** Represents numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14, -2.5).
    * `pi = 3.14159`

**2. Text (Strings)**

* **str:** Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).
    * `name = "Alice"`
    * `message = 'Hello!'`

**3. Boolean**

* **bool:** Represents a truth value, either `True` or `False`.
    * `is_raining = True`
    * `is_sunny = False`

**4. Sequences**

* **list:** An ordered, mutable collection of items.
    * `fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]`

* **tuple:** An ordered, immutable collection of items.
    * `coordinates = (10, 20)`

* **range:** Generates a sequence of numbers.
    * `numbers = range(5)  # Generates 0, 1, 2, 3, 4`

**5. Mapping**

* **dict:** An unordered collection of key-value pairs.
    * `person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}`

**Key Points:**

* **Dynamic Typing:** Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. Python infers the type based on the assigned value.
    * `x = 10` (x is an integer)
    * `x = "Hello"` (x is now a string)

* **Type Checking:** You can use the `type()` function to check the data type of a variable.
    * `print(type(x))`

This gives you a good overview of common data types in Python. Let me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any specific data type!
