Types of Jaascript:
Internal Javascript:
	JavaScript code is embedded directly within the HTML file using the <script> tag.
	This can be placed within the <head> or <body> section of the HTML document.
	Simple for small scripts and quick prototyping.
	Can clutter the HTML code, making it harder to read and maintain.
	Less efficient for larger scripts or scripts used across multiple pages.

External Javascript:
	External javascript is written in .js file, and then its linked in  the html file.
	JavaScript code is written in a separate file with the .js extension.
	The external file is linked to the HTML file using the src attribute within the <script> tag.
	Improved code organization and maintainability. Â  
	Reusable across multiple HTML pages
	Requires an additional HTTP request to load the external JavaScript file, which can slightly increase page load time.
