Loops are used when we need to execute a block of code repeatedly until the condition is becomes false.
It saves you from writing the same code multiple times.
There are 5 types of loops in javascript:
1. for of:
	For of statements loops through the values of an inerrable object sch as array strings. 
	<script>
		person={name:"Hirva",surname="Jobanputra"};
		name="";
		
		for (var x in person){
			name+=person[x]+" ";
		}
	</script>
2. for in:
	Used with object as well as array.
	Do not use in array if the index order is important.
	<script>
		var num=[1,2,3,4,6];
		let summ=0;
		for (x in num){
			sum+=x;
		}
		alert(sum);
	</script>
3. do while
4. while
