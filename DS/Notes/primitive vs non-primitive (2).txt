Primitive:
1. Primitive data structures are the basic data types holding a single value like int, char or Booleans.
2. Size of primitive data structures is predefined.
3. They are directly stored in memory allowing direct access.
4. They can only store a single value, making them less suitable for complex data organization.


Non-primitive:
1. Non-primitive data structures are more complex data types built from primitive data structures, allowing for the organization and storage of multiple values.

2. The size of non-primitive data structures can vary depending on the number of element they store.

3. They are often stored in memory using pointers, which can add layer of indirection.

4. They can store multiple values and be organized in various ways, making them more suitable for complex data management.
