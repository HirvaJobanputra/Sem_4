Primitive:
	Are most basic data types in a programming language. They represent simple values like integers, floating values, characters and Booleans.

Non-primitive:
	These are complex data structures built using primitive data types. they allow storing and organizing collections of data. 
**Primitive Data Structures**

* **Definition:** These are the most basic data types in programming languages. They represent simple values like integers, characters, and booleans.
* **Examples:** 
    * `int` (integer)
    * `float` (floating-point number)
    * `char` (character)
    * `bool` (boolean)
* **Characteristics:**
    * **Single Value:** Store only a single value of a specific data type.
    * **Fixed Size:** Have a predefined size in memory.
    * **Direct Access:** Accessed directly by their memory address.

**Non-Primitive Data Structures**

* **Definition:** These are more complex data structures built using primitive data types. They allow storing and organizing collections of data.
* **Examples:**
    * **Array:** An ordered collection of elements of the same data type.
    * **Linked List:** A linear collection of elements where each element points to the next.
    * **Stack:** A LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure.
    * **Queue:** A FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure.
    * **Tree:** A hierarchical data structure.
    * **Graph:** A non-linear data structure with nodes and edges.
* **Characteristics:**
    * **Multiple Values:** Can store multiple values, often of different data types.
    * **Variable Size:** Can grow or shrink dynamically.
    * **Indirect Access:** Accessed through pointers or references.

**Key Differences**

| Feature | Primitive Data Structure | Non-Primitive Data Structure |
|---|---|---|
| **Complexity** | Simple | Complex |
| **Data Storage** | Single value | Multiple values |
| **Data Type** | Single data type | Can store multiple data types |
| **Size** | Fixed size | Variable size |
| **Memory Allocation** | Stack memory | Heap memory |
| **Access** | Direct | Indirect (through pointers) |

**In Essence**

Primitive data structures are the building blocks, while non-primitive data structures are complex structures built upon them to organize and manage data efficiently. The choice of data structure depends on the specific needs of the problem at hand.
