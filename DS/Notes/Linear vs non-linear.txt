Define data structure and differentiate linear and non-linear data structure.


Data structure is a systematic way of storing and organizing data within computer's memory. It's not just about storing data randomly, its about arranging in a specific format that allows for efficient access, modification and processing of that data. 

There are two main types of data structures:
1. Linear data structure:
	Data elements are arranged in a sequential order, one after another. 
Example:
	Array:
	Stack:
	Queue:
	Linked lists:
	
	Linear data structures are represented in single dimensions, making them simpler to visualize and traverse.
	insert, update, push, pop etc operations are performed on linear data structures.
	undo/ redo, music playlist.(linked list).

2. Non-linear data structure:
	Data elements are not arranged in sequential order.
Example:
	Trees:
	Graphs:
	
	Represented in multi dimensions , allowing for more complex relationships between data elements. 
	Detecting cycles, finding paths etc operations are performed in non-linear data structures
	Social networks, file systems
